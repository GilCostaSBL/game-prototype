# üßæ Devlog Entry #5 ‚Äî Environment Verification and Final Setup  

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Phase:** Step 7 ‚Äî Run and Verify the Environment  

---

## üß© Summary  
The environment setup was successfully verified, confirming that Python, dependencies, and Pygame are functioning correctly. This completes the initial setup phase, ensuring the foundation is ready for game development.

---

## üß∞ Steps Completed  

### 1. Activated the Virtual Environment  
Inside the project directory:  
```bash
cd "C:\Users\gil.dacosta\Documents\Club AI Tools - Project\game-prototype"
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Confirmed that `(.venv)` appeared in the terminal prompt, indicating the environment was active.

---

### 2. Verified Dependencies  
Reinstalled all packages listed in `requirements.txt` to ensure consistency:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
‚úÖ No errors encountered ‚Äî dependencies confirmed.

---

### 3. Ran Initial Game Script  
Executed the main file to test the base configuration:  
```bash
python main.py
```
A Pygame window appeared briefly with a black screen and closed without errors, confirming display and library functionality.

---

### 4. Optional Environment Check Script  
Created and ran a simple verification file (`test_env.py`) to validate versions and environment status:  

```python
import sys
import pygame

print("Python version:", sys.version)
print("Pygame version:", pygame.__version__)

try:
    pygame.display.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((100, 100))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Environment Check")
    print("Environment verified ‚úÖ")
except Exception as e:
    print("Environment test failed ‚ùå", e)
finally:
    pygame.quit()
```

The script confirmed both Python and Pygame were working properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome  
- Environment and dependencies successfully configured.  
- Pygame window tested without errors.  
- Project structure stable and ready for development.  
- All previous steps (1‚Äì6) verified and validated.  

---

**Next Phase:** Begin **Prototype Development** ‚Äî start building gameplay mechanics and structure the project into modules.
